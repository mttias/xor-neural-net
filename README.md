An simple neural net predicting the output given a pair of binary inputs. 
The function is XOR, which is not linearly separable, so a neural net is a good choice for modeling it.

We use a simple 2-layer neural network (with one hidden layer and one output layer), which is trained using a basic form of gradient descent.

The loss function is cross entropy.# xor-neural-net
